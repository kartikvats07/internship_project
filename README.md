# B.Tech Student Profile Analysis

This project analyzes B.Tech student profiles to understand various factors affecting academic performance and predict CGPA based on different parameters.

## Project Structure

- `B.Tech Student Profile Survey.csv`: Original survey data
- `cleaned_BTech_Survey.csv`: Cleaned and preprocessed dataset
- `eda.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis notebook
- `Predicting_model.ipynb`: Machine Learning model for CGPA prediction

## Features

1. **Data Analysis**
   - Student demographics
   - Academic performance metrics
   - Study patterns
   - Extracurricular activities

2. **Visualizations**
   - CGPA distribution
   - Study hours analysis
   - Branch-wise comparisons
   - Career preferences

3. **Prediction Model**
   - CGPA prediction based on various factors
